<h1>Jive Messenger Installation Guide</h1>

<p>Jive Messenger is a powerful instant messaging (IM) and chat
server that implements the XMPP protocol. This document will guide 
you through installing Jive Messenger as a standalone
application. For a full list of features and more information, please
visit the Jive Messenger website: <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.org/messenger"
 target="_top">http://www.jivesoftware.org/messenger</a></p>

<p>In order to install Jive Messenger, you'll need a server environment
that meets the following requirements: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>JDK 1.5.0</b> (Java 5) or later. Java 5 is bundled with the 
platform-specific Jive Messenger installers. If you are using the ".zip" or ".tar.gz" 
distribution, you can check your java version by typing "java -version" at the 
command line and (if necessary) upgrade your Java installation by visiting 
<a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>.</li>
  <li>A supported database with a robust JDBC driver, or you can
choose to use the embedded database during the setup process. Supported 
databases and recommended JDBC drivers are detailed in the database 
documentation below.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation Overview</h2>
<p>To complete the installation of Jive Messenger, you'll need to
perform each of the following steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#database">Database</a> - prepare your database for Jive
Messenger. </li>
  <li><a href="#config">Setup</a> - Use the built in web based setup
tool to setup and verify the server configuration.</li>
  <li><a href="#tools">Admin Console</a> - use the web-based admin tool to
manage the server.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="distribution">Files in the Distribution</a></h2>
<p> The files in your distribution should be as follows (some
sub-directories omitted for brevity): </p>
<pre>jive_messenger/  
 |- readme.html
 |- license.html
 |- conf/
 |- bin/
 |- lib/
 |- plugins/
     |- admin/
 |- resources/
     |-database/
     |-security/
 |- documentation/</pre>

<ul> 
	 <li>The <tt>conf</tt> directory is where Jive Messenger stores
configuration files.</li>
  <li>The <tt>bin</tt> directory contains the server executables. Depending
on which distribution you installed, different executables will be available.</li>
  <li>The <tt>lib</tt> directory contains libraries necessary for
running Jive Messenger.</li>
  <li>The <tt>plugins</tt> directory contains server plugins. By
default, Jive Messenger ships with a web-based admin console plugin.</li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/database</tt> directory contains SQL schema files to
create new Jive Messenger databases, as well as upgrade scripts for
existing installations. </li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/security</tt> directory is where Jive Messenger
maintains keystores to support SSL connection security.</li>
  <li>The <tt>documentation</tt> directory contains server
documentation.</li>
</ul><p>

<h2><a name="database">Setup the Database</a></h2>
<p> <a>Jive Messenger uses a database to store it's data. To setup
your database you must load the appropriate database schema. You can find
schemas in the <tt>resources/database</tt> directory of this distribution. View
the </a><a href="database.html">database
setup</a> documentation to learn how to install the schemas and JDBC
drivers. Alternatively, you can select the embedded database during
the setup process.</p>
<p>Complete the database steps outlined in the database setup
documentation before proceeding further.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="config"></a>Setup the Server</h2>
<p>A web based, "wizard" driven setup and configuration tool is built
into
Jive Messenger. Simply launch Jive Messenger and use a web browser to
connect to the admin console. The default port for the
web-based admin console is 9090. If you are on the same machine as Messenger, the
following URL will usually work: 
<a href="http://127.0.0.1:9090">http://127.0.0.1:9090</a>.</p>

<p>If you used the Jive Messenger installer, a shortcut for starting the
a graphical launcher is provided. A button on the on the launcher allows 
you to automatically open your web browser to the correct URL to finish 
setting up the server:

</div>
</p>


<h3>Windows Service</h3>
<p>If you're running Messenger on Windows, you will likely want to
run Messenger as a standard Windows service after initial setup.
If you used the Windows installer, a <tt>messenger-service.exe</tt> file
will be in the <tt>bin</tt> directory of the installation. You can use
this executable to install and control the Jive Messenger service.
</p>

From a console window, you can run the following commands:
<ul>
		<li><tt>messenger-service /install</tt> -- installs the service.
		<li><tt>messenger-service /uninstall</tt> -- uninstalls the service.
		<li><tt>messenger-service /start</tt> -- starts the service
		<li><tt>messenger-service /stop</tt> -- stops the service.
</ul>

<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="images/windows_service.png" alt="Windows Service" width="557" height="223" align="center">
</div>
</p>

<p>You can also use the Services tool in the Windows Control Panel to start and
stop the service.</p>

<p>Note: the graphical launcher is not compatible with the Windows service
at this time. If you install the service, you should use service controls
as described above to control the server rather than the graphical launcher.</p> 


<!--
<h3>Solaris/Linux/MacOS X Deployment</h3>
<p>If you are deploying Messenger on these three supported Unix
systems, platform specific startup scripts and helper
applications are provided in the <tt>bin</tt> directory. Copy the
files from the appropriate directory into the <tt>bin</tt>
directory and set the <tt>JIVE_HOME</tt> environmental variable.&nbsp;
Edit the
<tt>config/wrapper.conf</tt> file to allocate the proper amount of heap
memory
for your deployment. On most systems, Messenger will need about 256MB
of heap memory for each 1000 simultaneous connections (<a href="#note1">1</a>).
<br>
</p>
<p>Run
the messengerd.sh shell script to start Messenger (you
may have to set it's executable permission using chmod). The wrapper
scripts and helper applications are fairly standard
daemon scripts supporting the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>start</tt> - starts the Messenger daemon process. </li>
  <li><tt>stop</tt> - stops the Messenger daemon process. </li>
  <li><tt>restart</tt> - restarsts the Messenger daemon process. </li>
  <li><tt>console</tt> - starts Messenger in the current shell allowing
the user to watch the Wrapper and Messenger's action on the terminal
and kill the application with CTRL-C. </li>
  <li><tt>dump</tt> - sends a <tt>kill -3</tt> signal to the daemon
process causing the JVM to do a full thread dump. </li>
</ul>
<p>The deployment service wrapper increases Messenger's reliability by
running a monitor in a separate process that watches the Messenger JVM.
If the Messenger JVM runs into trouble, the wrapper will detect and
restart Messenger automatically
ensuring that Messenger continues to be available to users.</p>
-->

<h2><a name="tools">Admin Console</a></h2>
<p>After completing the above steps, Messenger will be configured
and you can use the web-based admin console to administer
the server. The URL should be the same as you used to setup the server
unless you changed the port during the setup.<br>
