<h1>Jive Messenger Installation Guide</h1>

<p>Jive Messenger is a powerful instant messaging (IM) and chat
server that implements the XMPP protocol. This document will guide 
you through installing Jive Messenger as a standalone
application. For a full list of features and more information, please
visit the Jive Messenger website: <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.org/messenger"
 target="_top">http://www.jivesoftware.org/messenger</a></p>

<p>In order to install Jive Messenger, you'll need a server environment
that meets the following requirements: </p>
<ul>
  <li>JDK 1.5 or later. You can check your java version by typing "java
-version" at the command line. See <a href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>
for Java on your platform or download a Jive Messenger installer with
bundled JVM for your operating system.</li>
  <li>A supported database with a robust JDBC 2.0 compliant driver.
Supported databases and recommended JDBC drivers are detailed in the
database documentation below. Alternatively, you can use the embedded database.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation Overview</h2>
<p>To complete the installation of Jive Messenger, you'll need to
perform each of the following steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#database">Database</a> - prepare your database for Jive
Messenger. </li>
  <li><a href="#config">Setup</a> - Use the built in web based setup
tool to setup and verify the server configuration.</li>
  <li><a href="#tools">Admin Tool</a> - use the web-based admin tool to
manage the server.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="distribution">Files in the Distribution</a></h2>
<p> The files in your distribution should be as follows (some
sub-directories omitted for brevity): </p>
<pre>jive_messenger/  
 |- readme.html
 |- license.html
 |- conf/
 |- bin/
 |- lib/
 |- plugins/
     |- admin/
 |- resources/
     |-database/
     |-security/
 |- documentation/</pre>

<ul> 
	 <li>The <tt>conf</tt> directory is where Jive Messenger stores
configuration files.</li>
  <li>The <tt>bin</tt> directory contains the server executable scripts.
Run startup.bat or startup.ssh. If you used the Jive Messenger installer, 
native executables are also provided for your convenience. Below the base 
directory are platform specific deployment tools for running Messenger as service, etc.</li>
  <li>The <tt>lib</tt> directory contains libraries necessary for
running Jive Messenger.</li>
  <li>The <tt>plugins</tt> directory contains server plugins. By
default, Jive Messenger ships with a web-based admin console plugin.</li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/database</tt> directory contains SQL schema files to
create new Jive Messenger databases, as well as upgrade scripts for
existing installations. </li>
  <li>The <tt>resources/security</tt> directory is where Jive Messenger
maintains keystores to support SSL connection security.</li>
  <li>The <tt>documentation</tt> directory contains server
documentation.</li>
</ul><p>

<h2><a name="database">Setting Up the Database</a></h2>
<p> <a>Jive Messenger uses a database to store it's data. To setup
your
database you must load the appropriate database schema. You can find
schemas in the <tt>resources/database</tt> directory of this distribution. View
the </a><a href="database.html">database
setup</a> documentation to learn how to install the schemas and JDBC
drivers.</p>
<p> Complete the database steps outlined in the database setup
documentation before proceeding further.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="config"></a>Setup the Server</h2>
<p>A web based, "wizard" driven setup and configuration tool is built
into
Jive Messenger. Simply launch Jive Messenger and use a web browser to
connect to the admin console. The default port for the
web-based admin console is 9090. If you are on the same machine as Messenger the
following URL will
usually work: <a href="http://127.0.0.1:9090">http://127.0.0.1:9090</a>.</p>
<p>If you used the Jive Messenger installer, a shortcut for starting the
application is provided. Starting the server using this icon starts a
graphical launcher application. A button
on the launcher allows you to automatically open your web browser to
the correct URL
to finish setting up the server. Large deployments should use the
command line or Windows Service or *nix deployment options described
below to properly configure JVM settings before using. If you didn't
use the installer, you can start Jive Messenger using the startup script
in the <tt>bin</tt> directory.

<p>If you want to manually set up the server, edit the <tt>conf/jive-messenger.xml</tt>
file. To bypass the server's normal setup mode after manually
configuring the server, add
a &lt;setup&gt;true&lt;/setup&gt; element to the XML file to indicate
that the server
has been setup.</p>
<p>
If you wish to use SSL, run the keytool application that ships with the
Sun JDK to add the appropriate server certificates to the keystore
located in the <tt>security</tt> directory. Self-signed certificates
will work fine for testing. We've provided a dummy self-signed
certificate for your server if it is 127.0.0.1 (the localhost).</p>

<!--

<h3>Windows Service</h3>
<p>If you're running Messenger on Windows, you will eventually want to
run Messenger as a standard Windows service.
In order to do this, make sure the <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> environmental
variable is set to the base directory of your JRE/JDK directory or the <tt>jre</tt>
sub directory of your installation if you
installed a built-in JRE (Control Panel, System, Advanced, click on the
"Enviromental Variables" button). Next, copy all the files
from the <tt>bin/windows</tt> to the <tt>bin</tt> directory. Edit the
<tt>config/wrapper.conf</tt> file to allocate the proper amount of heap
memory
for your deployment. On most systems, Messenger will need about 256MB
of heap memory for each 1000 simultaneous connections (<a href="note1">1</a>).<br>
</p>

<p>Run <tt>install-messengerd.bat</tt> to install Messenger as a
windows service.
Now you can use the Control Panel, Administration Tools, Services
applet to start, stop, and restart Messenger as well as determine if it
starts with the server, what happens on failures, etc. Uninstall the
Messenger windows service by running
<tt>uninstall-messenger.bat</tt>.</p>
<p>You can also run Messenger directly using the included <tt>messengerd.bat</tt>
script using the same
service wrapper code that the Windows service uses. The service wrapper
provides quality of service tools that
ensure high reliability operation of Messenger including detecting hung
or failed processes and automatically
restarting Messenger.</p>
<h3>Solaris/Linux/MacOS X Deployment</h3>
<p>If you are deploying Messenger on these three supported Unix
systems, platform specific startup scripts and helper
applications are provided in the <tt>bin</tt> directory. Copy the
files from the appropriate directory into the <tt>bin</tt>
directory and set the <tt>JIVE_HOME</tt> environmental variable.&nbsp;
Edit the
<tt>config/wrapper.conf</tt> file to allocate the proper amount of heap
memory
for your deployment. On most systems, Messenger will need about 256MB
of heap memory for each 1000 simultaneous connections (<a href="#note1">1</a>).
<br>
</p>
<p>Run
the messengerd.sh shell script to start Messenger (you
may have to set it's executable permission using chmod). The wrapper
scripts and helper applications are fairly standard
daemon scripts supporting the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>start</tt> - starts the Messenger daemon process. </li>
  <li><tt>stop</tt> - stops the Messenger daemon process. </li>
  <li><tt>restart</tt> - restarsts the Messenger daemon process. </li>
  <li><tt>console</tt> - starts Messenger in the current shell allowing
the user to watch the Wrapper and Messenger's action on the terminal
and kill the application with CTRL-C. </li>
  <li><tt>dump</tt> - sends a <tt>kill -3</tt> signal to the daemon
process causing the JVM to do a full thread dump. </li>
</ul>
<p>The deployment service wrapper increases Messenger's reliability by
running a monitor in a separate process that watches the Messenger JVM.
If the Messenger JVM runs into trouble, the wrapper will detect and
restart Messenger automatically
ensuring that Messenger continues to be available to users.</p>
-->

<h2><a name="tools">Admin Console</a></h2>
<p>After completing the above steps, Messenger will be configured
and you can use the web-based admin console to administer
the server. The URL should be the same as you used to setup the server
unless you changed the port during the setup.<br>
