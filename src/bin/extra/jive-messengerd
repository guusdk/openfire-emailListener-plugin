# but should theoretically work on most UNIX like systems

# before running this script make sure $MESSENGER_HOME/bin/messenger is
# executable by the user you want to run messenger as
# (chmod +x $MESSENGER_HOME/bin/messenger)
#
# This script should be copied into /etc/init.d and linked into
# your default runlevel directory.
# You can find your default runlevel directory by typing: 
# grep default /etc/inittab
#
# Link to the directory like follows
# cd /etc/rc<num>.d
# ln -s ../init.d/jive-messengerd $90jive-messengerd

# If this is not set the script will look for /opt/jive_messenger, then /usr/local/jive_messenger
#export MESSENGER_HOME=

# Set this to tell which user to run messenger daemon as
# If this is not set the script will default to the user "root"
#export MESSENGER_USER=
