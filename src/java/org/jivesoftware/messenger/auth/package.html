<p>Provides the interfaces and classes necessary to create custom
authentication data providers for Messenger.</p>
<p>Authentication can be separately provided from user accounts and is
only used during initial XMPP session connection (an infrequent
operation considering the persistent nature of most XMPP connections).
Implementors should concentrate on the AuthProvider interface.</p>
<p>Messenger also includes the concept of user groups, used to assign
permissions to sets of users rather than having to assign permissions
to many individuals which can be tedious with large user populations.
The group concept is heavily used in Jive Forums upon which the
Messenger user system is based. Messenger 1.1 does not actively use
groups but group support was kept in Messenger to ease future
integration with Forums. Custom data provider implementors are
discouraged from implementing custom GroupProvider classes as the
interface may change. Contact <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com">Jive
Software</a> if group support
is needed in your deployment.</p>
