<h1>
IM Gateway Readme
</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The IM (instant messaging) gateway plugin allows users to log in to and
communicate through other instant messaging services via their Jabber
accounts.  The gateway itself provides a number of "transports" to other
protocols (AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo, etc).
</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p>
To help identify the differences between the plugin as a whole and the
underlying interfaces to external protocols (AIM, ICQ, etc), we refer
to the plugin itself as the "gateway" while we refer to the protocol
handlers as "transports".
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Copy the gateway.jar into the plugins directory of your Wildfire
installation. The plugin will then be automatically deployed. To upgrade to a
new version, copy the new gateway.jar file over the existing file.  Please
be aware that an upgrade will cause all of the users on your server who are
making use of the plugin to be disconnected from their external IM accounts.
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
By default, after the plugin has been deployed all of its features are disabled.
This plugin is configured via the "IM Gateway" sidebar item located under the
"System" tab in the Wildfire Admin Console.
</p>

<h2>Using the plugin</h2>
<p>
Before going into specifics, there are some important things you need to
know first.  A user must be registered with a transport in order to make
use of it.  Registration is the process wherein a user tells a transport
what username and password will be used with the external service.  This
process also places the transport JID in their roster to that the
transport itself can "hear" them come online, and act appropriately (logging
them in and such).  In this case, we interact with the user's roster directly,
so there is no need for a flood of subscription requests to the client itself.
A side effect of this is that only users of the local Wildfire server will
be able to make use of any transport on the gateway.
</p>

<h3>For admins:</h3>
<p>
The web interface of the gateway plugin provides a mechanism for setting
up registrations on a user's behalf, as well as editing and deleting them.
It also provides tools for monitoring who is using the gateway, their status,
etc.  In a typical setup, a user will be allowed to register an account
themselves.  See the next section for details on this.  You can also
set who has access to the specific transports and even enforce manual
registrations only.  If a specific transport has any options, they will
be made available from the web interface.
</p>

<h3>For end users:</h3>
<p>
Typically, users will use Service Discovery (aka disco) to find out what
services are available on a server, and then will be provided with a way
to register with whatever transports are made available.  Some clients
do not have the functionality to interact with transports.  In this case,
a server admin will need to register the user on their behalf. (see above)
</p>

<h2>Trouble shooting</h2>
<p>
If the plugin behaviour is not as expected you can enable server debug logging.
This will allow the plugin to start logging.  Server debug logging should only
be enabled temporarily, as it will generate a lot of additional logging that
will both slow your server down and consume a lot of disk space.
