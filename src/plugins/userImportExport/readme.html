<h1>User Import/Export Plugin Readme</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The user import/export plugin provides a way to import and export Jive Messenger user data via 
the Admin Console. The user data consists of jid (aka "username"), name, email address, password 
and roster list (aka "buddy list"). This plugin also can aid in the migration of users from other 
Jabber/XMPP based systems to Jive Messenger.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Copy the userImportExport.jar into the plugins directory of your Jive Messenger installation. 
The plugin will then be automatically deployed. To upgrade to a new version, copy the new 
userImportExport.jar file over the existing file.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Presently, there is nothing that can be configured for the user import/export plugin.</p>

<h2>Using the Plugin</h2>
<p>The plugin is accessed via the "User Import & Export" sidebar item located under the 
"Users/Groups" tab in the Admin Console. Note: if you are using LDAP as your user data source the 
following message will appear: "Sorry, because you are using LDAP as your user store this plugin 
will not work with your Messenger installation."

<li><b>Importing</b> - Select the "Import User Data" option from the user import/export selection 
page. On the import page, use the "Browse" button to locate the file that contains the user 
information you want to locate and then click on the "Import" button. If the plugin is successful 
in importing all user data, you will be presented with the message: "All users added successfully".
If the plugin was not successful in importing all user data you, will receive a message indicating 
what might have gone wrong. If during the import process, the plugin detects that you are trying to 
import a user that already exists in the system, it will not import that user or any roster 
information.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Exporting</b> - Select the "Export User Data" option from the user import/export selection 
page. User data can be exported either to a file or directly to the screen. To export to a file, 
select the "To File" radio button, enter the name you want your export file to be called in the 
"Export File Name" and then click on the "Export" button. Note: the plugin will automatically append
an ".xml" extension to the file name if it is not already present. To export to the screen, select 
the "To Screen" radio button and then click on the "Export" button. The user data will be placed in 
the provided text area.</li>
<br>
<li><b>Migration</b> - To import user data from another instant messenger system using the plugin, 
the import file must conform to the messenger-user-schema.xsd.xml schema file (located in the classes 
directory of the userImportExport.jar). When importing a user data file the plugin will first validate 
the file against the schema file." If the plugin cannot validate the import file the user data will 
not be imported. During the import process the plugin gives you the ability to update user roster 
entries domain names to server name of your Messenger installation. For example, say you have a user 
whose roster looks like: <br>
<br>
<textarea cols=95 rows=16>
<User>
  <Username>mike</Username>
  <Password>iamcool</Password>
  <Email>mike@mike.com</Email>
  <Name>Mike Jones</Name>
  <CreationDate>1125442154664</CreationDate>
  <ModifiedDate>1125442154664</ModifiedDate>
  <Roster>
    <Item jid="jane@im.olddomain.net" askstatus="-1" recvstatus="-1" substatus="3" name="Jane">
      <Group></Group>
    </Item>
    <Item jid="paul@xyz.net" askstatus="-1" recvstatus="-1" substatus="3" name="Paul">
      <Group></Group>
    </Item>
  </Roster>
</User>
</textarea>
<br>
<br>
Mike and Jane's accounts both reside on server whose domain name is "im.olddomain.net" and are being 
imported to a Messenger installation whose server name is "im.newdomain.net". If on the import screen 
the "Optional Existing Domain" field is filled in with "im.olddomain.net" (without the quotes) any 
roster item jid that contains "im.olddomain.net" will be replaced with "im.newdomain.net". So, in 
effect, the import file would be transformed to look like:
<br>
<br>
<textarea cols=95 rows=16>
<User>
  <Username>mike</Username>
  <Password>iamcool</Password>
  <Email>mike@mike.com</Email>
  <Name>Mike Jones</Name>
  <CreationDate>1125442154664</CreationDate>
  <ModifiedDate>1125442154664</ModifiedDate>
  <Roster>
    <Item jid="jane@im.newdomain.net" askstatus="-1" recvstatus="-1" substatus="3" name="Jane">
      <Group></Group>
    </Item>
    <Item jid="paul@xyz.net" askstatus="-1" recvstatus="-1" substatus="3" name="Paul">
      <Group></Group>
    </Item>
  </Roster>
</User>
</textarea></li>
</p>

<br>
<br>
Below is a sample of an exported user list from Messenger than contains two users, Joe and Sally, who
have added each other to their respective rosters.
<br>
<br>
<textarea cols=95 rows=16>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

      <Item jid="sally@localhost" askstatus="-1" recvstatus="-1" substatus="3" name="Sally">
